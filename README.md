## How to Run

This is a static web project and requires a local server to run correctly in a browser.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Sohan-2001/joke-reel.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd joke-reel
    ```

3.  **Start a local web server:**
    If you have Python installed, you can use its built-in HTTP server:
    ```sh
    python -m http.server
    ```
    If you have Node.js installed, you can use `npx`:
    ```sh
    npx serve
    ```

4.  **Open in your browser:**
    Visit `http://localhost:8000` (or the address provided by your server) to see the app in action.
